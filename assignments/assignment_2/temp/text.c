Explanation:
The job calls for a C program that looks for a certain process in a process tree that is rooted at a specific process and produces the desired information depending on input parameters. It is anticipated that the application will accept the following three parameters on the command line:
 
The term "ecosystem" refers to a group of people who work in the construction industry. process id is the PID of the process that you are looking for, which is a descendent of the BASH process that is now running. OPTION Is A Flag That Specifies What Information Should Be Displayed And It Is Optional.
The term "ecosystem" refers to a group of people who work together to solve problems. It should also show whether or not the requested process is dead, and if the corresponding option is selected, it should identify any child processes that are now dead.
The following is an in-depth discussion of the answer that was offered:
 
Include Statements The answer begins with a few include statements, which are as follows:
 
c: Include the following files before continuing: #include stdio.h #include stdlib.h #include string.h #include dirent.h For input and output activities, the stdio.h header file is present. It is necessary to include the stdlib.h header in order to use functions such as exit() and atoi (). For string operations like sprintf, the string.h header is included (). For directory-related functions such as readdir, the header dirent.h is included ().
 
Process Structure In order to hold process information, the solution provides a Process struct:
 
The term "ecosystem" refers to the process through which a company, organization, or other group of people, acquires a new piece of property. The term "ecosystem" refers to a group of people who work together to solve problems. Process;
This struct has the following four fields:
pid stands for process identification. ppid: The parent process ID.
state: the procedure's current status (e.g., "R" for running, "S" for sleeping, "Z" for zombie, etc.). name: The label given to the executable file that is connected to the process. Function getProcessInfo()
